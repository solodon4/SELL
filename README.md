SELL: Semantically Enhanced Library Languages
=============================================

Overview
------------

"*A Semantically Enhanced Library Language* (a SEL language or a SELL) is a dialect created by supersetting a language using a library and then subsetting the result using a tool that “understands” the syntax and se- mantics of both the underlying language and the library. The resulting language can be about as expressive as a special- purpose language and provide as good semantic guarantees as a special-purpose language. However, a SELL can rely on the tool chain and user community of a major general- purpose programming language." --Bjarne Stroustrup in "A rationale for semantically enhanced library languages".

This project is a collection of library languages exploring, using and following the SELL approach. SELLs don't have to be built on top of C++ even though that was the language of choice for our exploration of the idea.
